xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

ERROR REPORTS

We switched our focus to xv6 on RISC-V; see the mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git
repository on github.com.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".

                        Lab2: Scheduler

===========================================================================

1. Getting Started

Download a new directory of starter code of XV6 for Lab2 from this link:
`https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public`

To get started, look at the file proc.c.

2. Assignment (95%)

In this part of the assignment, you will change the scheduler from a simple round-robin to a priority scheduler. Add a priority value to each process (lets say taking a range between 0 to 31). The range does not matter, it is just a proof of concept. When scheduling from the ready list you will always schedule the highest priority thread/process first. All the processes should have a default initial priority of 10.

Add a system call to change the priority of a process. A process can change its priority at any time. If the priority becomes lower than any process on the ready list, you must switch to that process.

Goals: Understand how the scheduler works. Understand how to implement a scheduling policy and characterize its impact on performance. Understand priority inversion and a possible solution for it.

3. Bonus Section (upto 10%)

Implement up to two of the next three items. Each is a 5% bonus. To get credit for a bonus part, you must also develop a user test that will illustrate it.

To avoid starvation, implement aging of priority. If a process waits increase its priority. When it runs, decrease it. (Possible Bonus 1)

Implement priority donation/priority inheritance. (Possible Bonus 2)

Add fields to track the scheduling performance of each process. These values should allow you to compute the turnaround time and wait time for each process. Add a system call to extract these values or alternatively print them out when the process exits. (Possible Bonus 3)
